# Intermediate - Semantics and Accessibility. 💜

# 💻 About the Challenge

We know that most of the content available on the internet today can become accessible just by using the **correct** HTML elements.

You will receive a code with the project developed during Phase 02, but, unlike what was done in class, it **does not** present the correct semantics.
As you can see in the image below, the page ~~(except the button)~~ continues to function normally but, when you open the code, you will come across all the HTML elements all messed up... **👀**

Are you up for this challenge and make the site more accessible? **💜**
It will be very important for your learning to review and apply these new concepts. 

****Remember: try to challenge yourself but, if any difficulty arises, you can do a research and review some class!

To make it easier, we will leave the Figma link <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/rkDOHGPwwFtBNqEdHSuQPd/Projeto-02---Explorer?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">**here**</a> for you.

Good luck and let's code! **🚀**
